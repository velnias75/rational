# rational
A C++ rational (fraction) template class

Include `rational.h` to be able to do fraction calculations. By simply including `rational.h` and 
specifying the storage type (any integer variant) you can create and use a fractional data type. 
For example, `Rational<long> foo(3, 4)` would create a fraction named `foo` with a value of `3/4`, 
and store the fraction using the `long` data type. 

Simple to use, fast, and modifiable for your needs, because its all in the one header file 
`rational.h` at your access. It includes all basic mathematical operations as well as comparison 
operators, and is very flexible. If you would like to see a feature implemented, just ask here.

Features
--------

- exchangeable `GCD` algorithms *[`GCD_euclid_fast` (**default**), `GCD_euclid`and `GCD_stein`,
  choose as second template parameter, i. e. `Rational<long, GCD_stein> foo(3, 4)` for `Stein`]*
- optional *signed overflow/unsigned wrap* checking by throwing an `std::domain_error` exception
  (i.e. `Rational<storage_type, GCD_algo, Commons::Math::ENABLE_OVERFLOW_CHECK>`, default is
   no checking: `Commons::Math::NO_OVERFLOW_CHECK`)
- optimized for `signed` and `unsigned` types
- additional operators: 
  - `mod` to split inproper fractions in integer and fraction part
  - `abs` to get the absolute value
  - `%` (modulo) for rational modulo
  - increment (`++x` & `x++`) and decrement (`--x` & `x--`)
  - unary `plus`and `minus`
- Construction of inproper (mixed) fractions, i.e. `Rational<long> foo(2, 3, 4)`for `2 3/4` resp. 
  `2.75`
- Construction of approximate fractions, i.e. `Rational<long> foo(3.14159265358979323846)`for `Ï€` 
  resp. `245850922/78256779` *(approximation is dependent on compiler and chosen storage type)*
- Support for [the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library](https://gmplib.org/) as underlying
  storage type (include `gmp_rational.h`)
- Expression templates for domain specific programming (include `expr_rational.h`)

Notes for custom number types
-----------------------------

`rational.h` depends on following specialized fields of `std::numeric_limits<custom_type>`
- `std::numeric_limits<custom_type>::is_signed`
- `std::numeric_limits<custom_type>::is_integer`
- `std::numeric_limits<custom_type>::is_exact`

How to use
----------

See the test cases for examples on how to use `rational.h` with *C++ built-in types* as well
as with [the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library](https://gmplib.org/) as underlying
storage type.

The header `gmp_rational.h` contains specializations especially for 
[the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library](https://gmplib.org/) as underlying storage type.

If you use the *GMP extensions*, you'll need to link your application with `-lgmpxx -lgmp`
